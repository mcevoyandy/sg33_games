Privacy Policy
==============

Effective Date: February 3, 2025

A Word Game is developed Andy McEvoy. This Privacy Policy explains how I handle user data when you use my game.

Personal Information I Collect
------------------------------

None! The game does not ask for, manage, or store any personal data.

Information I Do Use
--------------------

The only data shared externally is high scores, which are sent to
[Unity Gaming Services](https://unity.com/solutions/gaming-services) using their anonymous sign in.
The information sent is:

* Your high score
* Number of words found
* The best word you had during the game and its score
* The longest word you had during the game and its score
* Date achieved

The total data sent to Unity Game Services will look like the following:

`z6FnVIe0kXHvkxzvRGiJZ2uyxI0a: "417,28,TUSHY,33,TUSHY,33,02/18/2025"`

Scores are sent to Unity Game Services during any game played while connected to the internet.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
------------------------------

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in this document, with an updated
effective date.
